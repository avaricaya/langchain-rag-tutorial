Software is an integral part of our society in both visible and invisible ways. Take a look at some of the modern conveniences of our life: cell phones, video games, medical imaging systems, and engines. The way we interact with information through software leaves very little that computer science does not touch. In computer science, students will learn the foundational material for software development, computer systems, and theory of computation so they, too, can harness the power of computers to solve the world’s problems. This creative discipline is for anyone who wishes to work hard and use logic, software, and hardware to solve problems.

We think there is no better place to pursue your degree than UWL. Small class sizes and accessible professors give students a level of attention not available on larger campuses. We have outstanding faculty who have many different interests, but who all share a love for teaching. A history of talented students, great facilities and undergraduate research opportunities, make for an ideal learning environment. The department is the second oldest in Wisconsin, only behind Madison, and has a fine reputation within the computing industry for over 50 years. 

The job market for computer scientists has always had plenty of opportunities and the demand continues. The National Bureau of Labor Statistics, in its rolling ten-year horizon *Occupational Outlook Handbook*, consistently projects the software industry to be among the fastest growing sectors of the economy.

### Computer Science internship policy

Credits earned in internships do not apply to major or minor requirements.

### Computer Science & Computer Engineering credit by examination policy

The Department of Computer Science & Computer Engineering awards credit by examination in [CS 120](/search/?P=CS%20120 "CS 120"). Each examination consists of a written test and a programming assignment. Information about the examination is available through the department chair’s office.

## General education writing emphasis

This department incorporates a significant amount of writing through the required courses instead of identifying particular courses as writing emphasis courses. Students who complete a major in this department will fulfill the general education [writing emphasis requirement](/undergraduate/generaleducation/#generaleducationrequirementstext).
