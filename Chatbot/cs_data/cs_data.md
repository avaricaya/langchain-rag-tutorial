## Introduction to Computational Thinking
 3 credits

Prerequisites: None

Computational thinking represents a universally applicable collection of concepts and techniques borrowed from computer scientists. This course is designed to teach how to think algorithmically; to examine the ways that the world's information is encoded and how this impacts our lives; to explore the capabilities and limitations of computers from the past, the present and the future; to apply software design diagrammatic techniques to model real-world systems; to learn how the rules of logic apply to computation, reasoning and discourse; to examine how computers both enhance and constrain our lives; to explore many of the problem solving strategies used by software developers and how they are useful to you. Offered Fall, Spring.

## Introduction to the Computing Environment / CPE 105
 1 credit

Prerequisites: None

This course introduces students to the use of the UNIX/Linux environment for file and process management, programming workflow, and the automation of computing tasks. The ethical responsibilities of shared computing resources are emphasized. Offered Fall.

## Digital Logic / CPE 212
 3 credits

Prerequisites: CS 120; concurrent enrollment in CS 270.

This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of digital logic circuit analysis and design. Basic Boolean logic primitives are introduced and described in truth tables, schematics and Boolean expressions. Combinational logic circuits are minimized with DeMorgan's Law and Karnaugh Maps. Level-sensitive and edge-triggered sequential logic elements are used as building blocks for finite state machines. Circuits are simulated using a structural hardware description language. Offered Spring.

## Introduction to Transient Analysis / CPE 301
 3 credits

Prerequisites: MTH 308; PHY 334.

This course introduces students to fundamentals of electrical circuit response over a period of time defined by the user and various analysis techniques for the response of first and second order electric circuits. The topics include time domain analysis of dynamic linear (first and second order) circuits, introduction to Laplace transformations, the use of Laplace transform in circuit analysis, and introduction to Fourier series analysis and its applications in circuits. Offered Fall.

## Introduction to Control Systems / CPE 302
 3 credits

Prerequisite: MTH 308; PHY 334

This course introduces students to control systems, the study of the analysis and regulation of the output behavior of dynamic systems subject to input signals, including the modeling, analysis, and design of linear feedback control systems. The emphasis of this course is on the basic theories and feedback controller design methods of linear time-invariant systems. Offered Occasionally.
